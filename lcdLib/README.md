# lcdLib from Project 3: LCD Game
## Introduction

lcdLib provides primitives for a pixel, rectangle, clearing the screen and a 5x7 font. Handles all the lower-level "messy stuff". 


Two types are defined (used as shortcut to typing "unsigned [type]"):

 - u_char : unsigned char

 - u_int : unsigned int


## Demo code

lcddemo.c is a program that displays a string and a circle


## Suggested exercises

In order to explore shape rendering, students are encouraged to create additinal "demo" programs that: 

 - create a sprite for Pacman!

 - create an animation for moving Pacman across the screen

 - Draw the other fonts hidden in the source files


## Installing the LCD lib (for other programs)

$ make install

## See Also

lcdLib requires timerLib (in directory ../timerLib).  Be sure to "make install" it first!
